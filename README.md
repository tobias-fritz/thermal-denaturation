# Fitting Thermal Denaturation Data

This project is based on Consalvi et al., (Protein Engineering, 2000) and [this notebook](https://github.com/eloyvallinaes/protein-physics-2022/blob/67d116063917e8a6a1fa7965dc36d79ffe8608e0/logisticModel.ipynb) for fitting a simple logistic model to chemical denaturation data.

The goal is to fit a sigmoidal denaturation curve and extract the standard reaction enthalpy ($\Delta H$) and midpoint temperature ($T_{m}$), assuming a two-state equilibrium and the reversibility of the process.

## How to Use

- Use the provided Jupyter Notebook to fit your own data.
- Ensure your data file has the appropriate column names or modify the notebook accordingly.
