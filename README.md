# Fitting thermal denaturation data

## Description 
Based on Consalvi et al.,Protein Engineering, 2000 and [this](https://github.com/eloyvallinaes/protein-physics-2022/blob/67d116063917e8a6a1fa7965dc36d79ffe8608e0/logisticModel.ipynb) notebook for fitting a simple logistic model to chemical denaturation data.<br>
Here I show how to fit a sigmoidal denaturation curve, assuming a two-state equilibrium and the reversability of the process.

## Setup

- All dependencies can be installed using either pip or conda.<br>
`pip install -r requirements.txt` <br>
`conda install --file requirements.txt` <br>

## How to use

- Use the Notebook to try and fit your own data!
